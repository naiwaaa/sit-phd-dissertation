In this chapter, a novel domain and task adaptation method for imitation learning was proposed.
The proposed adaptation method leverages the idea of repetition learning in neuroscience allowing the agent to repeatedly review the previously learned source task while learning a new target task.
The experimental results on simulated tasks with varying difficulties show that the proposed method is able to consistently provide high performance on the target task and minimizes the deterioration of the source task's performance.
Moreover,
it demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to transfer learning in enabling the agent to expand its knowledge without forgetting the knowledge learned from the source task,
resulting in an adapted agent that is able to perform well on both tasks.
Despite some limitations in the success rate and computational cost,
the results indicate the potential of the proposed method to be applied in practical imitation learning tasks.
