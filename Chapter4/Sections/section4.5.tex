In this section,
the effects of adversarial learning on training the \TAIL{} agent are discussed in detail.

The experimental results assessed in the previous section have shown the potential of \TAIL{} in tackling the task adaptation problem in imitation learning.
As shown in Tables \ref{ch:TAIL:tab:Result_SuccessRate_After_Target},
\TAIL{} could provide consistent and high performance in terms of success rate target tasks with varying difficulty levels.
This promising result demonstrates the effectiveness of applying adversarial learning,
in which the agent can extract the similarities and differences between source and target tasks to adapt its learned knowledge effectively.
Although the performance of \TAIL{} remained limited,
it has demonstrated the potential of adversarial learning in improving generalization in imitation learning.
