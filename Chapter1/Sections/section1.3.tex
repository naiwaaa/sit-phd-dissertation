The remainder of this dissertation is structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
        Chapter~\ref{ch:Background} provides essential background information that is relevant to all subsequent chapters and a literature review of the methods used for domain and task adaptations in imitation learning.

  \item
        Chapters~\ref{ch:DAIL},
        \ref{ch:TAIL},
        and \ref{ch:DTAIL} introduces three novel imitation learning agents.
        The work presented in these chapters has been published in~\cite{Mine_DAIL} and~\cite{Mine_DTAIL}.

  \item Chapter~\ref{ch:Discussion} discusses the potential of applying adversarial learning to improve generalization in imitation learning and the feasibility of utilizing the proposed agents in real-world tasks.

  \item Chapter~\ref{ch:Conclusion} concludes the dissertation and presents potential future research work.
\end{itemize}
