In this section,
the proposed \DAIL{} agent is introduced.
The agent relies on learning the domain-shared and domain-specific features in order to recover expert behaviors and adapt them to the learner agent domain.
The architecture of the proposed agent is illustrated in Figure \ref{ch:DAIL:fig:Architecture}.
The agent includes three deep feed-forward networks $F$, $G$, and $D$ that holds different responsibilities.
