In this chapter,
a novel \DAIL{} agent was introduced to address the domain adaptation problem in imitation learning.
The agent was able to extract the domain-shared and domain-specific features using adversarial learning.
The comprehensive evaluation on both low and high-dimensional tasks demonstrates that the policies learned by the proposed agent can imitate expert behaviors and adapt them to a distinct learner domain.
Thus, the potential of the proposed agent was verified.
