Reinforcement learning (RL) is an approach to solving sequential decision-making tasks in complex and stochastic environments.
In RL,
the learner or the decision-maker is called the \textit{agent}.
The thing it interacts with,
including everything outside the agent,
is called the \textit{environment}~\cite{RL_Sutton2018}.
A key aspect of RL is that it tries to mimic how humans learn new things from interaction with the environment.
In other words,
the RL agent has to actively interact with the environment through \textit{trial and error} in order to gather experiences and find a sequence of actions that can solve a given task.
RL is one of three basic machine learning paradigms,
as depicted in Figure~\ref{ch:Background:fig:AI_RL_VennDiagram}.
