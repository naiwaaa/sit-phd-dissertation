  I would like to express deep and sincere gratitude to my supervisor,
  Prof.~Kamioka Eiji,
  for his patience and motivation,
  for the continuous support and indispensable guidance which led me to the completion of this dissertation.


  I would also like to thank Dr.~Phan Xuan Tan,
  for inspiring and guiding me throughout my studies.
  It would have been more difficult without his invaluable advice and suggestions.


  I want to thank my family for their love and hard work in making it possible for me to complete this dissertation.
  I especially want to thank my parent for being there for me always.
  To my little brother,
  you have been my main inspiration all these years.


  Last but not least,
  I would be remiss in not mentioning Kem.
  Without her understanding and encouragement,
  it would be impossible for me to complete my study.
  I also have been very thankful to my friend,
  Tran Minh Chanh,
  for his support in brainstorming new ideas and encouragement to complete this dissertation.
